        In addition, the Services may include features that rely on the use of
        information stored on, or made available through, your mobile Device. We
        may also ask to collect or use the specific location of your mobile
        Device (e.g., by accessing your Device’s GPS). If you agree to allow
        access to your location, you agree that we and our service providers may
        collect such location-based information from your Device. We may also
        collect other information based on your location and your Device’s
        proximity to “beacons” and other similar proximity systems, including,
        for example, the strength of the signal between the beacon and your
        Device and the duration that your Device is near the beacon. The type of
        location data we collect depends on a number of factors, including the
        type of Device you are using (e.g., laptop, smartphone, tablet) and the
        type of connection enabled on your Device (e.g., wifi, Bluetooth,
        broadband cable). The RNC Apps, if they become available, or other
        features of the Services may rely on this location information in order
        to provide certain location-based services, such as promotional offers,
        merchandise offers, or event information or other RNC-related content
        that may be of interest to you. We may also use location information to
        improve the functionality of the RNC Apps and our other applications and
        services. If you do not wish to have this location information collected
        and used by the RNC, you may opt-out by disabling the location and
        Bluetooth features on your Device and/or in the RNC Apps. As a general
        note, you may choose not to provide certain information, but you may not
        be able to access certain content or take advantage of certain features
        of the Services.&nbsp;

          communicate; however, this feature, and how it is used and activated,

          signals are intentionally transmitted by a user, or whether a user is
          even aware of this. Despite current efforts, there is still
          disagreement amongst leading Internet standards organizations,
          industry groups, technology companies and regulators, concerning what,
          if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals and no
          standard has been adopted to date. The RNC takes privacy and security
          very seriously. With respect to “do not track signals,” we currently
          do not respond to do-not-track signals. Third parties may collect
          information about an individual consumer's online activities over time
          and across different Internet websites or online services when the
